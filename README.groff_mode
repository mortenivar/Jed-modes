                                 Description:
                                 
groff-mode for the Jed editor is an extension editing mode that facilitates
the editing of groff/nroff/troff etc. files. It has a colour highlighting
scheme, but it also has a few other features, such as the toggling of inline
markup styles, previewing of the file in a pdf-viewer as well as being able
to convert and install OpenType or TrueType fonts in a chosen user directory
for use with groff.

                                Installation:
                                
Copy groff_mode.sl to directory in your jed library path, e.g.
/usr/share/jed/lib. If you only have write access to your own home
directory, then do something like this:

 cd
 mkdir -p .jed/lib
 cp groff_mode.sl .jed/lib

In both cases, add the following lines to your ˝/.jedrc:

  %#v+
  %% groff-mode customization
  set_jed_library_path (get_jed_library_path () + "," + dircat (getenv ("HOME"), ".jed/lib"));
  autoload ("groff_mode", "groff_mode");
  add_mode_for_extension ("groff", "mm");
  add_mode_for_extension ("groff", "ms");
  add_mode_for_extension ("groff", "me");
  add_mode_for_extension ("groff", "mom");
  add_mode_for_extension ("groff", "mdoc");
  add_mode_for_extension ("groff", "man");
  Groff_Pdf_Viewer = "zathura";
  Groff_Cmd = "groff -Tps -k -K utf-8 -dpaper=a4 -P-pa4";
  %#v-
  
The two last lines specify your pdf-viewer and some parameters to groff.
If you like them as they are, you don't need to include them, as they are
already the default. Otherwise, you can change them to your liking.

                                    Usage:
                                    
F10 -> Mode will show some menu items of available commands.

For the mode to be autoloaded, it relies on the extension of the file.
Therefore, if you edit groff files using e.g. the "mm" macro set, then it is
a good idea to call the file "myfile.mm", then the groff mode will be loaded
automatically and the -mm parameter passed to groff when compiling the
document. You can also load the mode with alt-x and then groff_mode.

F9 renders the current buffer in a pdf-viewer. You may keep the rendered
document open in the pdf-viewer and F9 will update it with no need to save
the file in between.

"ctrl-c I" will convert and install a TrueType or OpenType font for use with
groff. You must set the environment variable GROFF_FONT_PATH in your shell
configuration file. It should only be a single directory. For the bash
shell, write these two lines to the file, ~/.bashrc:

 GROFF_FONT_PATH=$HOME/.groff-fonts
 export GROFF_FONT_PATH

Then your fonts will be installed to the hidden directory ~/.groff-fonts
under your home directory. The directory in the GROFF_FONT_PATH variable is
just complementary to the hard-coded font paths in groff so it doesn't
override anything.

To have an environment variable propagated to the X environment for use with
xjed, you might enter the two lines above into the file, ~/.xprofile.
